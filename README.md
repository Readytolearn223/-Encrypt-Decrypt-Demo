# Encryption Demo 

This project demonstrates symmetric and asymmetric encryption and decryption using the programming language Python. 

# Files 

1 Symmetric_demo.py 
Encrypts and decrypts a short message using symmetric encryption 

2 Asymmetric_demo.py 
Encrypts and decrypts a short message using asymmetric encryption 

# Functionality 

1 Symmetric Encryption 

Symmetric encryption will first  generate a 16-byte symmetric key. Next, it will take an input message and encrypt it. Then it decrypts the ciphertext using the same symmetric key. Lastly, it will show the key that was used, the input message, the ciphertext, and the decrypted message. 

2 Asymmetric Encryption 

Asymmetric encryption  will first generate a 2048-bit asymmetric key pair. Next, it will encrypt a message using the public key. Then it will decrypt the message using the private key. Lastly, it will show the key that was used, the input message, the ciphertext, and the decrypted message.
